		<p>In my blog, I will be motivating the youth in kakuma refugee camp. Most of refugee youths have lost hopes in life and they are only thinking within the box. I will be using my blog to shade light on the minds of these youth and open thier eyes to see the good thing they can get out of regugee camp. It is not only in the refugee camp where people are not much aware of the good things going on, but it is also in the other parts of this world. since my blog will be online, everyone will be benefiting from this since the information can be read from anywhere in this world</p>
		<p>My aim is to empower the youth to become self-motivated and have courage to pursue their dreams in life. I also want the youth to cope up the recent technological changes and adapt to the world of today. I am a researcher and I intend to be encouraging the youth on the recend trends in technology.</p>
